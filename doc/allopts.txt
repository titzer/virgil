What are all the possible optimizations to be done on constructors?
* remove trivial constructors
- compute purity of constructor
  + escape analysis => remove unused object allocations
- compute purity of object
  + if no object identity => hash cons objects
- escape analysis => allocate object on stack
- inline constructor into allocation site
- replace field reads with constant
- make field reads pure
- allocate space for multiple objects in one request
  - (need to know allocated objects in constructor)
- replace pure computed fields with their expressions
- cache pure computed expressions as fields
- streamline allocation stub: 
  - allocate and write fields in one stub
- object/array boilerplate: mostly-constant object and array
  allocations are copies+mutate from a template "boilerplate" object
- collapse fields that hold the same value into one field
- remove write barriers from field initializations
- eliminate zeroing for straight-line, fully initialized classes
- jvm: move constructor code into Class.<init>
- split object into multiple objects
  - depending on initialized / uninitialized parts
  - hash cons immutable object parts
- pack small fields into header word
  - bools -> bits
  - bytes -> upper / lower part of type word

Optimizations for variants
- Pack primitive-only variants into words
- Inline single-ref variant cases which can be distinguished from
  other non-overlapping variant cases

Useful Inter-procedural analyses:
 - parameters:
   - used/unused
	=> remove unused parameters in caller
   - nullity
	=> remove null checks in body
   - procedure definitely performs null/bounds/zero/negative check
	=> remove dominated checks in caller
   - parameter doesn't escape procedure
	=> remove dead allocations
 - pure
   => remove unused result of calls, hoist out of loops
 - no side-effects
   => load/store elimination across call
 - idempotent (1* = 1)
   => hoist out of loops
 - no exceptions
   => remove source information
 - non-recursive (maximum stack addition)
   => remove stack overflow checks
 - bounded stack height
   => remove stack overflow checks
 - return value
   - doesn't escape
   - null/nonnull
	=> remove null checks in caller
   - specific type
	=> devirtualize
   - never used
        => dead code eliminate the return expressions
 - cost
   - estimated dynamic cost of call versus body
	=> guide inlining decisions
 - Temporally disjoint fields automatically reused by compiler.
	=> save space on heap
 - Rarely-set fields automatically moved to side object by compiler.
	=> save space on heap
 - Heuristics for specializing methods for some parameters. Partial evaluation
 - Prioritize compiler metrics globally by their impact on program metrics
 - potentially-foldable branch analysis


- Specialization optimizations
  - how much would type/value specialization benefit from parameter X?
  - constant folding, strength reduction
  - devirtualization (known receiver type)
  - inlining
  - loop unrolling (known trip counts)
  - dead code elimination (evaluate predicates)
  - load elimination (known heap contents)
  - bounds check elimination
  - duplicate superclass method down (reduces polymorphism on this)
  - infer more specific field type per subclass
  - specialize partial applications
  - specialize partial applications of constructor (new copy of class)
